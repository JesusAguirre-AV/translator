##Project desciption
This is a menu driven program that is used as a programmer calculator

##Technologies used
This program uses basic implementations of try/catch methods and basic java utilities such as parseInt in order to convert Strings to integers or inyegers to hexadecimals and converting characters to there ascii decimal value

##Favorite feature(s)
The use of a menu to select the starting type of value, whether it is integer, hexadecimal, binary, or characters which can be used in coding as well as incripting

##Snippet from code
List<String> stringList = new ArrayList<>();
        for(char ch : string.toCharArray()){
            stringList.add(""+ch);
        }
//This is a simple yet elegant way to convert a string into a list of decimals based on their ascii values

while (temp>0){
                binary.insert(0,temp%2);
                temp/=2;
            }
//This snippet of code is how decimal values are converted to binary and is the idea that inspired this program as a whole

##Instalation and usage
Once it is pulled from github it runs as a menu prompt that list the options of what value should be translated into the rest and then it can read a String value to conver to different base values
